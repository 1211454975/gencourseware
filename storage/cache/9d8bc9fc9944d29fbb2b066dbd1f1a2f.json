  "content": "Today, we're going to learn about how walking robots plan their movements. Imagine you're playing a video game where you control a robot. You want the robot to walk from point A to point B without falling over. Scientists and engineers use something called Model Predictive Control (MPC) to help robots do this. MPC is like a game plan that the robot follows to move smoothly and efficiently.",
  "type": "content",
  "key_points": [
    "Walking robots use MPC to plan their movements.",
    "MPC helps minimize energy use and ensures the robot doesn't fall.",
    "There are different ways to use MPC, some with strict plans and others that adapt as the robot moves.",
    "Planning movements in real-time is challenging because robots are complex."
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Think of MPC as a GPS for robots, constantly updating the best path.",
    "Like a soccer player adjusting their run to catch a ball, robots adjust their steps based on their current position."
