  "content": "Today, we're going to learn about how robots move and the forces that affect their movement. Imagine a robot as a person trying to walk. Just like us, robots need to balance and move carefully to not fall over.",
  "type": "content",
  "key_points": [
    "Robots move using forces and torques applied at their joints.",
    "The Center of Mass (CoM) is crucial for a robot's balance.",
    "External forces are needed for a robot to move in directions other than gravity.",
    "The position where forces are applied affects the robot's angular momentum and stability."
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Think of a robot as a skateboarder. To turn, they shift their weight (changing their CoM) and use their feet to push (applying external forces).",
    "A robot arm picking up an object must adjust its grip (force application point) to keep the object steady (control angular momentum)."
