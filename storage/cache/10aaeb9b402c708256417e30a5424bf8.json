  "title": "Understanding Robot Walking Dynamics",
  "content": "Today, we're going to learn about how robots walk on flat ground. Imagine a robot trying to walk straight. The ground pushes back on the robot's feet, helping it move forward without falling. This push is called a 'contact force'. We'll see how these forces help the robot stay balanced.",
  "type": "content",
  "key_points": [
    "Contact forces from the ground help the robot walk.",
    "The Center of Pressure (CoP) is where the ground's push is strongest.",
    "The robot's movement and balance depend on the CoP and its own motion."
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Think of walking on a tightrope. You adjust your arms to stay balanced, similar to how a robot adjusts its CoP.",
    "If you push a shopping cart, the force you apply makes it move. Similarly, the ground's force helps the robot move."
